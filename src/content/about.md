I am a former crypto-focused engineer now building an independent family-office-style allocation practice.

My core interests are **finance**, **economics**, and **geopolitics**. I study how power, technology, and policy reshape capital flows across regions and sectors.

This website is where I publish my public thinking and long-term portfolio lenses.

### Principles

- Build conviction through first-principles research.
- Share useful frameworks publicly.
- Allocate capital with discipline, not noise.

### Areas of Focus

- Global macro regime changes
- China, US, and Europe relative dynamics
- Crypto infrastructure and onchain business models
- Commodities and civil nuclear innovation
